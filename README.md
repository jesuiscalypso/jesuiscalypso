### Howdy!

I'm a computer science graduate with a deep love for automation and cybersecurity. I like making little tools that help people out on their day to day lives.

I like tabletop roleplaying games, and dabble in writing from time to time. My hobbies include reading, gaming and predictably, coding a whole bunch.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Doigt, a GUI autoclicker for idle games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NeoVim!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me a message through my socials.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I still don't know what a Monad is.
